        <p>Simple, fast, and delicious describes this baked cod recipe. Bake for two sets of 10 minutes each and you
            have
            the
            perfect ten dinner! This recipe was a favorite request from a local restaurant. They closed after years in
            business
            and we are happy to share a version of their most requested recipe. I serve this with rice pilaf and fresh
            spinach
            that has been lightly seared in olive oil and garlic. Yummy!

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place 2 tablespoons butter in a microwave-safe bowl; melt in microwave on high, about 30 seconds. Stir
                buttery round crackers into melted butter.</li>
            <li>Place remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a 7x11-inch baking dish. Melt in the preheated oven, 1 to 3
                minutes. Remove dish from oven.
            </li>
            <li>Coat both sides of cod in melted butter in the baking dish. </li>

                mixture. Place back in oven and bake until fish is opaque and flakes easily with a fork, about 10 more
                minutes.

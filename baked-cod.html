        <p>Simple, fast, and delicious describes this baked cod recipe. Bake for two sets of 10 minutes each and you
            have
            the
            perfect ten dinner! This recipe was a favorite request from a local restaurant. They closed after years in
            business
            and we are happy to share a version of their most requested recipe. I serve this with rice pilaf and fresh
            spinach
            that has been lightly seared in olive oil and garlic. Yummy!
